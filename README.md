# Lumina Frontend

Next.js 16 web application for the Lumina Network, a blockchain-based vesting vault and token streaming platform built on Stellar Soroban.

[![CI](https://github.com/real-venus/wavelum-frontend/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/real-venus/wavelum-frontend/actions/workflows/test.yml)

## Overview

Lumina Frontend is the user-facing dashboard for Lumina's on-chain vesting infrastructure. It lets users create and manage vesting schedules, participate in governance, track token streams, and view real-time analytics. The application is built with the Next.js App Router and talks to a Node.js backend API and to Stellar Soroban smart contracts.

## Architecture at a glance

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User([User]) --> FE[Lumina Frontend<br/>Next.js 16]
    FE -->|REST / JSON| API[Lumina Backend API]
    FE -->|RPC| RPC[Soroban RPC]
    FE -->|connect / sign| Wallet[Stellar Wallet]
    Wallet -->|signed tx| RPC
    RPC --> Contracts[(Soroban<br/>Contracts)]
    API --> DB[(Database)]
```

The frontend never holds private keys. Read traffic flows to the backend API and to Soroban RPC, while any state-changing transaction is built client-side, signed by the user's wallet, and submitted to the network. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Turbopack) |
| Language | [TypeScript 5](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) |
| Styling | [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) |
| Linting | [ESLint 9](https://eslint.org/) with `eslint-config-next` |
| Blockchain | [Stellar Soroban](https://stellar.org/) smart contracts |
| Runtime | [React 19](https://react.dev/) |

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.9 or newer** (required by Next.js 16; the CI pipeline builds on Node 20)
- **npm 10 or newer** (ships with Node 20+)
- A Stellar wallet for testing on-chain flows, for example [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/)

Check your versions:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Quick start

Five steps from clone to running locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/stellar-network-builders/lumina-frontend.git
cd lumina-frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create your local environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev

# 5. Open the app
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

## Environment variables

All client-exposed variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` so that Next.js inlines them into the browser bundle. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values for your environment.

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Yes | `http://localhost:4000` | Base URL of the Lumina backend API. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SEP10_AUTH_PATH` | No | `/auth/sep10` | Backend path for SEP-10 challenge/token exchange. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL` | Yes | `https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org` | Soroban RPC endpoint used for contract reads and transaction submission. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK` | Yes | `testnet` | Active Stellar network: `testnet`, `futurenet`, or `mainnet`. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | No | empty | Sentry DSN for client-side error reporting. Leave empty to disable. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` | No | empty | WalletConnect project ID for wallet sessions. |

See the [Next.js environment variables guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) for how values are resolved across `.env`, `.env.local`, and deployment settings.

> Anything prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is visible to the browser. Never put secrets behind that prefix.

## npm scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start the development server with hot reload at `http://localhost:3000`. |
| `npm run build` | Create an optimized production build. |
| `npm start` | Serve the production build (run `npm run build` first). |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint across the project. |
| `npm run lint:strict` | Run ESLint failing on any warning (`--max-warnings 0`). |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check the project with `tsc --noEmit`. |
| `npm run test` | Run the Vitest unit/component suite once. |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Run the test suite with coverage reporting. |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run Playwright visual regression tests. |
| `npm run test:e2e:update` | Regenerate Playwright visual baselines. |

## Continuous integration

Every push to `main` and every pull request runs the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/test.yml):

- **quality** — ESLint, TypeScript type-check, and a production Next.js build (with `.next/cache` reuse).
- **test** — Vitest unit/component tests in headless Chromium, with coverage uploaded as an artifact.
- **bundle-analysis** (PRs) — builds with `@next/bundle-analyzer` and uploads the treemap reports.
- **accessibility** — Tailwind color-contrast audit (WCAG AA).
- **visual-review** — Storybook component snapshots via Chromatic.

Two companion workflows run on pull requests:

- [Visual Regression](.github/workflows/visual-regression.yml) — Playwright screenshot comparison against baselines in `e2e/visual-baselines/` (1% diff threshold). Generate baselines with `npm run test:e2e:update` and commit them; then drop `continue-on-error` to make it a blocking gate.
- [Deploy Preview](.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml) — deploys a Vercel preview and comments the URL on the PR (skipped automatically when `VERCEL_TOKEN` is absent).
